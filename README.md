# Computer Craft Powerplant
This repo comprises the code for the Powerplant in ComputerCraft/Tekkit that me and a friend plan on constructing in a multiplayer server in the future. The idea is that we charge for electricity at a set rate per EMC, and, using teleport pipes supply them with that electricity. The system is envisioned to be almost entirely automated, perhaps only requiring maintainence every so often.

The folders in this directory contain/will contain the code for the following functions;
* db -  this folder contains both the server and the client libraries for the db server. it will quite likely be SQL-esque, though will probably not support as many different commands, or be able to query many fields quickly. The username will end up being the field used and it will thus be quickest to find information via someones username. Other fields will be slower as each record must be looped through and the appropriate field checked for conformality.
